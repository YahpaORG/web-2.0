A dedicated group of healthcare professionals and students came together to create coronavirus information guides, develop community resource lists, and translate health announcements into languages like Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese. YAHPA aims to improve healthcare access, quality, and equity for Asian seniors and unilingual immigrants, addressing language barriers and reducing disparities in care."
